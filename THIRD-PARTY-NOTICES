## What is this?

This package exposes states to parse spaces and/or tabs.

## When should I use this?

This package is useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-factory-space
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {factorySpace} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-factory-space@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {factorySpace} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-factory-space@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {factorySpace} from 'micromark-factory-space'
import {codes} from 'micromark-util-symbol/codes'
import {types} from 'micromark-util-symbol/types'

// A micromark tokenizer that uses the factory:
/**
 * @this {TokenizeContext}
 * @type {Tokenizer}
 */
function tokenizeCodeFenced(effects, ok, nok) {
  return start

  // â¦

  /** @type {State} */
  function info(code) {
    if (code === codes.eof || markdownLineEndingOrSpace(code)) {
      effects.exit(types.chunkString)
      effects.exit(types.codeFencedFenceInfo)
      return factorySpace(effects, infoAfter, types.whitespace)(code)
    }

    if (code === codes.graveAccent && code === marker) return nok(code)
    effects.consume(code)
    return info
  }

  // â¦
}
```

## API

This module exports the identifier [`factorySpace`][api-factory-space].
There is no default export.

### `factorySpace(â¦)`

Parse spaces and tabs.

There is no `nok` parameter:

*   spaces in markdown are often optional, in which case this factory can be
    used and `ok` will be switched to whether spaces were found or not
*   one line ending or space can be detected with `markdownSpace(code)` right
    before using `factorySpace`

###### Examples

Where `â` represents a tab (plus how much it expands) and `â ` represents a
single space.

```markdown
â
â â â â 
ââ 
```

###### Parameters

*   `effects` (`Effects`)
    â context
*   `ok` (`State`)
    â state switched to when successful
*   `type` (`string`)
    â type (`' \t'`)
*   `max` (`number`, default: `Infinity`)
    â max (exclusive)

###### Returns

Start state (`State`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 16+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This package works with `micromark` version 3+.

## Security

This package is safe.
See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to
submit a security report.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.
See [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    â code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `asciiHexDigit(code)`

Check whether the [character code][code] represents an ASCII hex digit (`a`
through `f`, case insensitive, or `0` through `9`).

An **ASCII hex digit** is an ASCII digit (see `asciiDigit`), ASCII upper hex
digit, or an ASCII lower hex digit.

An **ASCII upper hex digit** is a character in the inclusive range U+0041
(`A`) to U+0046 (`F`).

An **ASCII lower hex digit** is a character in the inclusive range U+0061
(`a`) to U+0066 (`f`).

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    â code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `asciiPunctuation(code)`

Check whether the [character code][code] represents ASCII punctuation.

An **ASCII punctuation** is a character in the inclusive ranges U+0021
EXCLAMATION MARK (`!`) to U+002F SLASH (`/`), U+003A COLON (`:`) to U+0040 AT
SIGN (`@`), U+005B LEFT SQUARE BRACKET (`[`) to U+0060 GRAVE ACCENT
(`` ` ``), or U+007B LEFT CURLY BRACE (`{`) to U+007E TILDE (`~`).

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    â code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `markdownLineEnding(code)`

Check whether a [character code][code] is a markdown line ending.

A **markdown line ending** is the virtual characters M-0003 CARRIAGE RETURN
LINE FEED (CRLF), M-0004 LINE FEED (LF) and M-0005 CARRIAGE RETURN (CR).

In micromark, the actual character U+000A LINE FEED (LF) and U+000D CARRIAGE
RETURN (CR) are replaced by these virtual characters depending on whether
they occurred together.

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    â code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `markdownLineEndingOrSpace(code)`

Check whether a [character code][code] is a markdown line ending (see
`markdownLineEnding`) or markdown space (see `markdownSpace`).

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    â code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `markdownSpace(code)`

Check whether a [character code][code] is a markdown space.

A **markdown space** is the concrete character U+0020 SPACE (SP) and the
virtual characters M-0001 VIRTUAL SPACE (VS) and M-0002 HORIZONTAL TAB (HT).

In micromark, the actual character U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (HT) is
replaced by one M-0002 HORIZONTAL TAB (HT) and between 0 and 3 M-0001 VIRTUAL
SPACE (VS) characters, depending on the column at which the tab occurred.

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    â code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `unicodePunctuation(code)`

Check whether the [character code][code] represents Unicode punctuation.

A **Unicode punctuation** is a character in the Unicode `Pc` (Punctuation,
Connector), `Pd` (Punctuation, Dash), `Pe` (Punctuation, Close), `Pf`
(Punctuation, Final quote), `Pi` (Punctuation, Initial quote), `Po`
(Punctuation, Other), or `Ps` (Punctuation, Open) categories, or an ASCII
punctuation (see `asciiPunctuation`) (**\[UNICODE]**).

See **\[UNICODE]**:\
[The Unicode Standard](https://www.unicode.org/versions/).\
Unicode Consortium.

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    â code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `unicodeWhitespace(code)`

Check whether the [character code][code] represents Unicode whitespace.

Note that this does handle micromark specific markdown whitespace characters.
See `markdownLineEndingOrSpace` to check that.

A **Unicode whitespace** is a character in the Unicode `Zs` (Separator,
Space) category, or U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (HT), U+000A LINE FEED (LF),
U+000C (FF), or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) (**\[UNICODE]**).

See **\[UNICODE]**:\
[The Unicode Standard](https://www.unicode.org/versions/).\
Unicode Consortium.

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    â code

###### Returns

[micromark][] utility to splice and push with giant arrays.

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to splice for giant arrays, which V8 bugs
out on.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-chunked
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {push, splice} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-chunked@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {push, splice} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-chunked@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {push, splice} from 'micromark-util-chunked'

// â¦

nextEvents = push(nextEvents, [
  ['enter', events[open][1], context],
  ['exit', events[open][1], context]
])

// â¦

splice(events, open - 1, index - open + 3, nextEvents)

// â¦
```

## API

This module exports the identifiers [`push`][api-push]
and [`splice`][api-splice].
There is no default export.

### `push(list, items)`

Append `items` (an array) at the end of `list` (another array).
When `list` was empty, returns `items` instead.

This prevents a potentially expensive operation when `list` is empty,
and adds items in batches to prevent V8 from hanging.

###### Parameters

*   `list` (`Array<unknown>`)
    â list to operate on
*   `items` (`Array<unknown>`)
    â items to add to `list`

###### Returns

Either `list` or `items` (`Array<unknown>`).

### `splice(list, start, remove, items)`

Like `Array#splice`, but smarter for giant arrays.

`Array#splice` takes all items to be inserted as individual argument which
causes a stack overflow in V8 when trying to insert 100k items for instance.

Otherwise, this does not return the removed items, and takes `items` as an
array instead of rest parameters.

###### Parameters

*   `list` (`Array<unknown>`)
    â list to operate on
*   `start` (`number`)
    â index to remove/insert at (can be negative)
*   `remove` (`number`)
    â number of items to remove
*   `items` (`Array<unknown>`)
    â items to inject into `list`

###### Returns

Nothing (`void`).

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to decode numeric character references.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {decodeNumericCharacterReference} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {decodeNumericCharacterReference} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {decodeNumericCharacterReference} from 'micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference'

decodeNumericCharacterReference('41', 16) // 'A'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('65', 10) // 'A'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('A', 16) // '\n'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('7F', 16) // 'ï¿½' - Control
decodeNumericCharacterReference('110000', 16) // 'ï¿½' - Out of range
```

## API

This module exports the identifier:
[`decodeNumericCharacterReference`][api-decode-numeric-character-reference].
There is no default export.

### `decodeNumericCharacterReference(value, base)`

Turn the number (in string form as either hexa- or plain decimal) coming from
a numeric character reference into a character.

Sort of like `String.fromCharCode(Number.parseInt(value, base))`, but makes
non-characters and control characters safe.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    â value to decode
*   `base` (`number`, probably `10` or `16`)
    â numeric base

###### Returns

Character (`string`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].

## What is this?

This package exposes a list of known tag names to markdown.

## When should I use this?

This package is only useful if you want to build an alternative to micromark.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-html-tag-name
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-html-tag-name@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-html-tag-name@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'micromark-util-html-tag-name'

console.log(htmlBlockNames) // ['address', 'article', â¦]
console.log(htmlRawNames) // ['pre', 'script', â¦]
```

## API

This module exports the identifiers [`htmlBlockNames`][api-html-block-names]
and [`htmlRawNames`][api-html-raw-names].
There is no default export.

### `htmlBlockNames`

List of lowercase HTML âblockâ tag names (`Array<string>`).

The list, when parsing HTML (flow), results in more relaxed rules (condition
6\).
Because they are known blocks, the HTML-like syntax doesnât have to be strictly
parsed.
For tag names not in this list, a more strict algorithm (condition 7) is used
to detect whether the HTML-like syntax is seen as HTML (flow) or not.

This is copied from:
<https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks>.

> ð **Note**: `search` was added in `CommonMark@0.31`.

### `htmlRawNames`

List of lowercase HTML ârawâ tag names (`Array<string>`).

The list, when parsing HTML (flow), results in HTML that can include lines
without exiting, until a closing tag also in this list is found (condition
1\).

This module is copied from:
<https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks>.

> ð **Note**: `textarea` was added in `CommonMark@0.30`.

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to normalize identifiers found in markdown.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-normalize-identifier
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {normalizeIdentifier} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-normalize-identifier@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {normalizeIdentifier} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-normalize-identifier@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {normalizeIdentifier} from 'micromark-util-normalize-identifier'

normalizeIdentifier(' a ') // 'A'
normalizeIdentifier('a\t\r\nb') // 'A B'
normalizeIdentifier('Ð¢ÐÐÐÐÐ') // 'Ð¢ÐÐÐÐÐ'
normalizeIdentifier('Ð¢Ð¾Ð»Ð¿Ð¾Ð¹') // 'Ð¢ÐÐÐÐÐ'
```

## API

This module exports the identifier
[`normalizeIdentifier`][api-normalize-identifier].
There is no default export.

### `normalizeIdentifier(value)`

Normalize an identifier (as found in references, definitions).

Collapses markdown whitespace, trim, and then lower- and uppercase.

Some characters are considered âuppercaseâ, such as U+03F4 (`Ï´`), but if their
lowercase counterpart (U+03B8 (`Î¸`)) is uppercased will result in a different
uppercase character (U+0398 (`Î`)).
So, to get a canonical form, we perform both lower- and uppercase.

Using uppercase last makes sure keys will never interact with default
prototypal values (such as `constructor`): nothing in the prototype of `Object`
is uppercase.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    â identifier to normalize

###### Returns

Normalized identifier (`string`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].

[micromark][] utility to resolve subtokens.

[Resolvers][resolver] are functions that take events and manipulate them.
This is needed for example because media (links, images) and attention (strong,
italic) arenât parsed left-to-right.
Instead, their openings and closings are parsed, and when done, their openings
and closings are matched, and left overs are turned into plain text.
Because media and attention canât overlap, we need to perform that operation
when one closing matches an opening, too.

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to make URLs safe.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-sanitize-uri
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {sanitizeUri} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-sanitize-uri@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {sanitizeUri} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-sanitize-uri@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {sanitizeUri} from 'micromark-util-sanitize-uri'

sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a&amp;b') // 'https://example.com/a&amp;amp;b'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a%b') // 'https://example.com/a%25b'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a%20b') // 'https://example.com/a%20b'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/ð') // 'https://example.com/%F0%9F%91%8D'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/', /^https?$/i) // 'https://example.com/'
sanitizeUri('javascript:alert(1)', /^https?$/i) // ''
sanitizeUri('./example.jpg', /^https?$/i) // './example.jpg'
sanitizeUri('#a', /^https?$/i) // '#a'
```

## API

This module exports the identifiers [`normalizeUri`][api-normalize-uri] and
[`sanitizeUri`][api-sanitize-uri].
There is no default export.

### `normalizeUri(value)`

Normalize a URL.

Encode unsafe characters with percent-encoding, skipping already encoded
sequences.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    â URI to normalize

###### Returns

Normalized URI (`string`).

### `sanitizeUri(url[, pattern])`

Make a value safe for injection as a URL.

This encodes unsafe characters with percent-encoding and skips already
encoded sequences (see [`normalizeUri`][api-normalize-uri]).
Further unsafe characters are encoded as character references (see
[`micromark-util-encode`][micromark-util-encode]).

A regex of allowed protocols can be given, in which case the URL is sanitized.
For example, `/^(https?|ircs?|mailto|xmpp)$/i` can be used for `a[href]`, or
`/^https?$/i` for `img[src]` (this is what `github.com` allows).
If the URL includes an unknown protocol (one not matched by `protocol`, such
as a dangerous example, `javascript:`), the value is ignored.

###### Parameters

*   `url` (`string`)
    â URI to sanitize
*   `pattern` (`RegExp`, optional)
    â allowed protocols

###### Returns

Sanitized URI (`string`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].

## What is this?

This package exposes constants used throughout the micromark ecosystem.

## When should I use this?

This package is useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.
Itâs useful to reference these constants by name instead of value while
developing.
[`micromark-build`][micromark-build] compiles them away for production code.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-symbol
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {codes} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-symbol/codes@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {codes} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-symbol/codes@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {codes} from 'micromark-util-symbol/codes'
import {constants} from 'micromark-util-symbol/constants'
import {types} from 'micromark-util-symbol/types'
import {values} from 'micromark-util-symbol/values'

console.log(codes.atSign) // 64
console.log(constants.characterReferenceNamedSizeMax) // 31
console.log(types.definitionDestinationRaw) // 'definitionDestinationRaw'
console.log(values.atSign) // '@'
```

## API

This package has four entries in its export map: `micromark-util-symbol/codes`,
`micromark-util-symbol/constants`, `micromark-util-symbol/types`,
`micromark-util-symbol/values`.

Each module exports an identifier with the same name (for example,
`micromark-util-symbol/codes` has `codes`), which is an object mapping strings
to other values.

See the code for the exposed data.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 16+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This package works with `micromark` version 3+.

## Security

This package is safe.
See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to
submit a security report.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.

## When should I use this?

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

*   If you *just* want to turn markdown into HTML (with maybe a few extensions)
*   If you want to do *really complex things* with markdown

See [Â§ Comparison][comparison] for more info

## What is this?

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

`micromark` is an open source markdown parser written in JavaScript.
Itâs implemented as a state machine that emits concrete tokens, so that every
byte is accounted for, with positional info.
It then compiles those tokens directly to HTML, but other tools can take the
data and for example build an AST which is easier to work with
([`mdast-util-to-markdown`][mdast-util-to-markdown]).

While most markdown parsers work towards compliancy with CommonMark (or GFM),
this project goes further by following how the reference parsers (`cmark`,
`cmark-gfm`) work, which is confirmed with thousands of extra tests.

Other than CommonMark and GFM, micromark also supports common extensions to
markdown such as MDX, math, and frontmatter.

These npm packages have a sibling project in Rust:
[`markdown-rs`][markdown-rs].

*   to learn markdown, see this [cheatsheet and tutorial][cheat]
*   for more about us, see [`unifiedjs.com`][site]
*   for updates, see [Twitter][]
*   for questions, see [Discussions][chat]
*   to help, see [contribute][] and [sponsor][] below

## Install

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {micromark} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {micromark} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

Typical use (buffering):

```js
import {micromark} from 'micromark'

console.log(micromark('## Hello, *world*!'))
```

Yields:

```html
<h2>Hello, <em>world</em>!</h2>
```

You can pass extensions (in this case [`micromark-extension-gfm`][gfm]):

```js
import {micromark} from 'micromark'
import {gfm, gfmHtml} from 'micromark-extension-gfm'

const value = '* [x] contact@example.com ~~strikethrough~~'

const result = micromark(value, {
  extensions: [gfm()],
  htmlExtensions: [gfmHtml()]
})

console.log(result)
```

Yields:

```html
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> <a href="mailto:contact@example.com">contact@example.com</a> <del>strikethrough</del></li>
</ul>
```

Streaming interface:

```js
import {createReadStream} from 'node:fs'
import {stream} from 'micromark/stream'

createReadStream('example.md')
  .on('error', handleError)
  .pipe(stream())
  .pipe(process.stdout)

function handleError(error) {
  // Handle your error here!
  throw error
}
```

## API

`micromark` core has two entries in its export map: `micromark` and
`micromark/stream`.

`micromark` exports the identifier [`micromark`][api-micromark].
`micromark/stream` exports the identifier [`stream`][api-stream].
There are no default exports.

The export map supports the [`development` condition][development].
Run `node --conditions development module.js` to get instrumented dev code.
Without this condition, production code is loaded.
See [Â§ Size & debug][size-debug] for more info.

### `micromark(value[, encoding][, options])`

Compile markdown to HTML.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string` or [`Buffer`][buffer])
    â markdown to parse
*   `encoding` (`string`, default: `'utf8'`)
    â [character encoding][encoding] to understand `value` as when itâs a
    `Buffer`
*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    â configuration

###### Returns

Compiled HTML (`string`).

### `stream(options?)`

Create a duplex (readable and writable) stream.

Some of the work to parse markdown can be done streaming, but in the
end buffering is required.

micromark does not handle errors for you, so you must handle errors on whatever
streams you pipe into it.
As markdown does not know errors, `micromark` itself does not emit errors.

###### Parameters

*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    â configuration

###### Returns

Duplex stream.

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

##### Fields

###### `allowDangerousHtml`

Whether to allow (dangerous) HTML (`boolean`, default: `false`).

The default is `false`, which still parses the HTML according to `CommonMark`
but shows the HTML as text instead of as elements.

Pass `true` for trusted content to get actual HTML elements.
See [Â§ Security][security].

###### `allowDangerousProtocol`

Whether to allow dangerous protocols in links and images (`boolean`, default:
`false`).

The default is `false`, which drops URLs in links and images that use dangerous
protocols.

Pass `true` for trusted content to support all protocols.

URLs that have no protocol (which means itâs relative to the current page, such
as `./some/page.html`) and URLs that have a safe protocol (for images: `http`,
`https`; for links: `http`, `https`, `irc`, `ircs`, `mailto`, `xmpp`), are
safe.
All other URLs are dangerous and dropped.
See [Â§ Security][security].

###### `defaultLineEnding`

Default line ending to use when compiling to HTML, for line endings not in
`value` (`'\r'`, `'\n'`, or `'\r\n'`; default: first line ending or `'\n'`).

Generally, `micromark` copies line endings (`\r`, `\n`, `\r\n`) in the markdown
document over to the compiled HTML.
In some cases, such as `> a`, CommonMark requires that extra line endings are
added: `<blockquote>\n<p>a</p>\n</blockquote>`.

To create that line ending, the document is checked for the first line ending
that is used.
If there is no line ending, `defaultLineEnding` is used.
If that isnât configured, `\n` is used.

###### `extensions`

Array of syntax extensions (`Array<SyntaxExtension>`, default: `[]`).
See [Â§ Extensions][extensions].

###### `htmlExtensions`

Array of syntax extensions (`Array<HtmlExtension>`, default: `[]`).
See [Â§ Extensions][extensions].
